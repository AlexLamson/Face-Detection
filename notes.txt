TRAINING
generate many random haar-like features
for each image in the training set
	for each haar-like feature
		run the haar-like feature on the image
		if feature was positive, add 1 to its counter
for each haar-like feature
	feature score = counter / # training images
	if feature score is < 0.5
		feature score = 1.0 - feature score
		flip the black and white sides
sort all the haar-like features in descending order by their score

APPLYING
for each block of pixel in the image
	for each haar-like feature (in the now sorted order)
		run the haar-like feature on the image
		if it is positive and the last feature, mark the block
		if it is positive and not the last feature, continue
		if it is negative, move to the next block
